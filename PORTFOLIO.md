# Portfolio 

This assignment was chosen because it was the most challenging and time consuming. The goal of the assignment was to teach students how to write programs in functional programming languages like Scala and Scheme, also make students understand how programming languages are implemented. Therefore, the objective was to a build an interpreter using Scala for Scheme. 

Since, the assignment involved learning and utilizing more than one programming language and paradigm it helped me to the understand the concepts and techniques of software design. The designed interpreter was broken into many small problems that required algorithms to solve. It required creating algorithms that supported multiple arguments, pair data types, grammar, expressions, arithmetic and function class etc. Therefore, the assignment demonstrates the ability to develop effective problem-solving skills. Student explored many ideas and encountered many issues to develop the program.
